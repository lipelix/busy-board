<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Bad weather, long afternoons, soft illnesses, all of these can be a reason for your child and you to get bored. There are plenty of toys or even busy (or activity) boards that you can grab in a store. But why not to make one by yourself?

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The first step was to grab all the stuff and make a plan. I wanted to have a board with some activities and lights. I wanted to have a switch to turn on/off the lights and a button because it reduces the risk that lights will be turned on all the time.

Most work will involve lights and wiring. I used a battery box to power the lights. I also used a switch to turn on/off the single Blue LED and two buttons to turn on the lights on each side.

Connect the LED to the breadboard (which provides a 3V power source) and put it on the board to see what it looks like. (Those transparent plastic things are from the packaging of the pacifier - they are perfect for this purpose)

In the following step, I added a Wiring box and put 🟦 LED to the middle of it (let's call it nose). Put 🟥 and 🟨 LED Filaments as eyes to the sides - it looks much better.

The next step was to create holes for buttons, switch to the Wiring box, and place batteries inside the Wiring box. I used a step drill to make a hole - it’s plastic, so it was easy. Grab a heat gun to catch the battery box inside the Wiring box.

💔 You can see that 🟦 LED does not fit the LED holder - because the holder is for 3mm LEDs, but I have a 5mm one. Never mind…
